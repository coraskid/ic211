Case: Medical Implant Risk Analysis
https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-medical-implant-risk-analysis/

This Article discusses the risk of Medial devices, specifically Corazon’s implantable heart monitoring device. The company’s product was very user friendly. The device came with an app to be able to monitor and control the device, as well as keeping a record of all medical data. They made promises about securing data and also worked with charities to lower costs for those who needed this device but could not afford it. The problem arose when a vulnerability in the wireless connectivity was found. It allowed an attacker to force a reset on the device exploiting the hard-coded data on the device. After consultations, the company concluded that the risk of harm was negligible. 

While the article didn’t mention further actions on behalf of Corazon, I believe that they should have offered to fix this issue free of charge for those interested, as well as immediately fixed the bug and pursued further testing on the device. The reason for this is that users have a blind trust in this company for something very important, their life. To be honest and trustworthy (1.3 in code of ethics and professional conduct) is an integral part of ethical conduct and they would be violating it by letting this device stay in use without at least offering the option of a replacement. 

Another big violation of the code would be to avoid harm (1.2). This is not happening because this vulnerability was brought to their attention and they decided that it was a negligible risk. While it may not have been likely, it is different when you are dealing with the health, potentially life or death health, of a living being. This section says, "‘Harm’ means negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust.” Risking a life is a significant and unjust consequence for just replacing or at least offering to replace this device. The company also needs to make sure its following code 2.7, to “foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.” This means that they need to make sure every user and potential user of the device is aware of this issue. 

I believe all programmers have an ethical responsibility to society for how their software is used while it is in your control. Ultimately, software is a product, it can be sold, bought and stolen. Once it is out of your hands, it is not technically your responsibility. It is still your responsibility to do everything you can to prevent your software from getting into the hands of people that will use it unethically. Separately, the societal implications of treating users as the ‘product’ is drastic. Our generation has only really known this society, so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but it is clear it has taken away a lot of time, which is certainly our most valuable resource.
